# nvtt
A neovim 1 minute typing test

## Things to note:
Uses the file you're currenty in as the test, so you can practice writing code and such in the most realistic way possible, within the same tool you'll be writing it in
Sets buftype=nofile, so don't worry, it won't change the file at all
Will take you back to the top if you get to the end of the file before the timer finishes

Type :NVTT to start
